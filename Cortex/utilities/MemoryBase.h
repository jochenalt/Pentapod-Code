/*
 * Memory.h
 *
 * Base class to store persistent data in EEPROM. Use by deriving your memory
 * class from MemoryBase, and initializing it within the constructor.
 *
 * Example:
 * class DerivedMemClass : MemoryBase {
 * ...
 * 	struct  {
 *		... my persistent data ...
 *	} persMem;
 * }
 *
 * DerivedMemClass::DerivedMemClass()
 * MemoryBase((void*)&(persMem),sizeof(DerivedMemClass::persMem)) {
 *    ... initialize default settings of data in persMem
 * }
 *
 * to initialize, call MemoryBase::setup(). In the loop, call MemoryBase::loop.
 * When changing persMem, call delayedSave(), which queues up the change to be written in a couple of seconds.
